The Game
=============

The **Illusion Box Activity** is an engaging visual experiment that presents a collection of optical illusions for users to explore and interact with. The activity includes multiple illusions, each with a unique visual effect that plays with perception. Users can reveal the true nature of each illusion by pressing the spacebar or hovering over the image. The activity also features pagination, allowing users to browse through different sections, with each section containing six illusions.

Some of the illusions included are:

- **Revolving Circles Illusion:**  
  When you move your head back and forth while focusing on the center dot, the circles formed by rhombi appear to rotate, creating an illusion of movement.

- **Bulging Lines Illusion:**  
  In this illusion, the user can choose between two color schemes:
  - **GLWB (Gray-Light Gray-White-Black):** The lines appear to bulge outward from the center.
  - **GLBW (Gray-Light Gray-Black-White):** The lines seem to bend inward towards the center.  
  Hovering over the image reveals that the lines are actually straight, and the illusion is created by the surrounding elements.
